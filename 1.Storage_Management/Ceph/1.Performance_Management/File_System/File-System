                                                      CONCLUSION
The purpose of this paper was to compare the performances of three 64bit filesystems using  modern SSD technology, 
under Ubuntu Linux OS.Expected results were that the most modern filesystem, btrfs, will have significantly better performances 
for allread tests,  but  it was detectable only  for random  read,and not  for sequential read  as  well.It  was  expected  that 
the btrfs has a lowerwrite performance due to the CoW method, which was  confirmed in  all  tests. On  the  other  hand, two overwrite
update filesystems, ext4 and xfs, exhibited very similar performance.We can  note that the btrfs filesystem is  still  not fully accepted
for Ubuntu Linux distributions,as it is not in there commended choices during  the installation  procedures,  but has  to
be installed additionally.On  the  other  hand,there  are numerous papers that  prove quality performance of  the btrfs filesystem
on the other Linux distributions,like Centos, etc. in which the btrfs is present in the basic offer on the install
